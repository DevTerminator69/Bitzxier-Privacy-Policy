## Collection of Data

Fairy is a free-to-use service, and we do not charge any fees. To ensure optimal performance and deliver the best experience, we collect specific data, including:

- **Server IDs**: For managing server-specific configurations such as self-roles, automated moderation, anti-spam, anti-nuke measures, giveaways, and welcome messages.
- **User IDs**: To enforce moderation rules, blacklist users, and manage roles.
- **Message Content**: For automated moderation features, including spam detection, blacklist word filtering, and role assignment triggers.

All data is securely stored using AES encryption standards to ensure the safety of your information.

## Use of Data

We do not share or sell your data to third parties. The data collected is strictly used to:

- Enable features such as automod, anti-spam, anti-nuke, and self-role assignments.
- Improve the user experience and maintain a safe environment in Discord servers.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy align with our Terms of Service unless otherwise specified.

## Message Monitoring

Fairy monitors message content within servers to enforce automated moderation features, including:

- **Automod**: Detecting and managing spam, blacklisted words, and unwanted content.
- **Anti-Spam**: Identifying and mitigating spammy behavior.
- **Anti-Nuke**: Protecting servers from harmful activities.
- **Role Automation**: Assigning roles based on specific triggers.

Message monitoring is strictly limited to providing these functionalities and maintaining server safety.

## Access to Server Data

Access to data collected by Fairy is limited as follows:

- **Server Owners and Administrators**: Can view and manage server-specific configurations.

We implement strict access controls to ensure your data is only accessed for legitimate purposes.

## Data Storage and Retention

We retain server data, including configurations and blacklisted user IDs, for **up to 7 days** after the bot is removed from your server. This allows for a seamless reconfiguration process if Fairy is re-added. If you wish to have your data permanently deleted sooner, you can contact the developer with your request.
